validator.py

Defines the Verifier agent, responsible for evaluating the underwriting agentâ€™s
risk classification and reasoning. If the risk assessment is appropriate and
justified, the workflow proceeds to the consultant agent. If the assessment is
inadequate or inconsistent with the reasoning, control is routed back to the
underwriter agent for revision.
